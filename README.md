# Final project for Game Programming with Data Structure

## About the project

This is a game made as a final project for the subject Game Programming with Data Structures for third term of Computer Programming at Conestoga.

The game is a Survival Game, the idea is: 

The player should try to survive as much as they can.
As the game goes on, the score will increase as the missiles hit the ground.
Mean while the enemies will try to catch the player.
If either, enemies or missiles hit the player, the game is over.
