I finished my part. I worked mainly with GameUI and GameManager to connect the different screens with the game, 
making it more intuitive for the user. 

To make it I had to use these videos as a reference:

I did all the textures for buttons and some for specific screens. 
The most difficult part was making the buttons work.

In general, I had to learn how to make buttons and how to manage the screens.
